#Welcome to Jonathan Skee's Google Data Analytics Certificate Capstone Project SQL code!
#Here are the steps I took in SQL (using Google's BigQuery) to help address the business task...

#First, I wanted to inspect the data. I wanted to make sure all columns imported correctly
SELECT * #Selects the relevant columns in the table
FROM capstone-project-378818.cyclistic_data.cyclistic_trip_data; #Selects the table

#Next, I needed to confirm that the data cleaning I conducted in Excel worked

#To do this, I first confirmed that no nulls exist in the important columns
SELECT member_casual, ride_length, day_of_week, rideable_type
FROM capstone-project-378818.cyclistic_data.cyclistic_trip_data
WHERE member_casual IS NULL OR ride_length IS NULL OR day_of_week IS NULL OR rideable_type is NULL; #Finds nulls in relevant columns

#No nulls are found!

#Next, I wanted to make sure I removed all the duplicate values from the ride_id column
SELECT DISTINCT ride_id #Selects non-duplicate values only
FROM capstone-project-378818.cyclistic_data.cyclistic_trip_data;

#The same number of columns appears, so no duplicates are present!

#Then, I wanted to run some descriptive statistics calculations to get an idea of what I'm working with

#First, I found the shortest and longest ride lengths
SELECT
  MIN(ride_length) AS min_ride_length, #Finds the min ride
  MAX(ride_length) AS max_ride_length #Finds the max ride
FROM capstone-project-378818.cyclistic_data.cyclistic_trip_data;

#I also wanted to look at the day of the week that travelers most often ride on
SELECT day_of_week
FROM   capstone-project-378818.cyclistic_data.cyclistic_trip_data
GROUP  BY day_of_week #Organizes the results by day of week
ORDER  BY COUNT(*) DESC; #Ranks the days of the week in order of popularity, with most popular showing first

#The most popular day to ride is Monday!

#I then wanted to see what the most popular bike type is (classic bike, electric bike, or docked bike)
SELECT rideable_type
FROM   capstone-project-378818.cyclistic_data.cyclistic_trip_data
GROUP  BY rideable_type
ORDER  BY COUNT(*) DESC;

#The classic bike is the most popular, followed by the electric bike and docked bike

#Now, I want to find the average trip duration
SELECT AVG(ride_mins) 
  FROM (SELECT (EXTRACT(SECOND FROM ride_length)/60 + EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM ride_length) + EXTRACT(HOUR FROM ride_length)*60) AS ride_mins #Converts the ride_length column (which was in hh:mm:ss format) into a numeric data type so I can run an AVG function
  FROM capstone-project-378818.cyclistic_data.cyclistic_trip_data);

#The average ride lasts around 13 minutes!

#Lastly, I wanted to see what percent of rides were completed by annual members vs. casual riders
SELECT member_casual, COUNT(*),
COUNT(*)/(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM capstone-project-378818.cyclistic_data.cyclistic_trip_data) #Returns as a percentage
FROM capstone-project-378818.cyclistic_data.cyclistic_trip_data
GROUP BY member_casual;

#Roughly 82% of rides are done by annual members, while about 18% are done by casual riders

#These are the key statistics I needed to know. Further analysis will be conducted in R!
